## Why TBG?
I recently became fascinated by telegram bots, being this. A new but powerful tool in which many programmers have been approached under the same fascination. Many bots have been seen throughout the messaging system itself, some more useful than others. Among them I can mention my beloved **XhibalbaBot**, a project I started several years ago and which I continue to maintain to this day with increasingly clean and scalable structures.

The main reason why I decided to take the challenge of making a CLI tool that was able to generate bots from a relatively clean code, was the fact that every time I had to make a bot on my own, I had to do it from scratch, that is, configure the whole environment and program all the files.

BUT GOOD NEWS! This is over, because with something as simple as a token, you can have a fully functional bot.

**Note**: We will be adding new languages, structures and improvements as this project is accepted.

### How to install?
#### Step 1:
You only need one thing to create a project, a bot token from [@Botfather](http://t.me/botfather "botfather") or the direct link with https://www.t.me/botfather and follow the instructions to register your bot and get the **token**.

#### Step 2:
##### For Windows users:
- You have to install the node client to get **NPM**, you can download it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Open a cmd or powershell with administrator permissions and enter the follow command
``` sh
npm install -g telegram-bot-generator
``` 
##### For Linux users:
- Follow this guide about how install **NPM** in your respective distro: https://linuxconfig.org/install-npm-on-linux
``` sh
sudo npm install -g telegram-bot-generator
```

Run the command:
``` sh
telegram-bot-generator
```
Enter your `<token>` from [@Botfather](http://t.me/botfather "botfather")
Select the flavor of your bot and that is all.
